                        Jon frowned at the science textbook, the concepts of photosynthesis and cellular respiration tangling in his mind. He couldn’t keep them straight, and the upcoming test loomed over him like a dark cloud.
                        
                        James nudged Jon during lunch. “You look worried. What’s up?”
                        
                        Jon groaned. “Science. I just don’t get it.”
                        
                        Susan, overhearing, sat down beside them. “Let’s do a study session. We can use flashcards and diagrams to make it easier.”
                        
                        That afternoon, they gathered in the park, spreading their materials on a picnic table. Susan explained the processes step-by-step, using diagrams and visual aids. She showed Jon how the sun’s energy was captured by plants, and how it was converted into chemical energy during photosynthesis. James created flashcards to quiz Jon on key terms and concepts.
                        
                        As they worked together, the confusion began to clear. Jon started to see the connections between the different processes. He practiced drawing diagrams and explaining the concepts out loud, with Susan and James providing feedback and encouragement.
                        
                        On test day, Jon felt a surge of confidence. He answered each question carefully, remembering the study sessions and the diagrams they had drawn. When the test results came back, he saw a significant improvement.
                        
                        “Couldn’t have done it without you two,” Jon said, feeling grateful and more motivated than ever.
