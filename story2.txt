                            The English Expedition
                            Jon stared at the blank page in front of him, the essay assignment feeling like an insurmountable mountain. Words jumbled in his head, refusing to form coherent sentences. English had always been his nemesis, and this essay was no different.
                            
                            The bell rang, and Jon sighed, packing up his things slowly. As he walked out of the classroom, James caught up with him. “What’s up, Jon? You look stressed.”
                            
                            Jon groaned. “This essay. I just can’t write anything good.”
                            
                            Susan, walking with James, joined the conversation. “What’s the topic?”
                            
                            Jon handed her the assignment sheet. “We’re supposed to write about our favorite book and why we like it, but I can’t even get started.”
                            
                            Susan read the sheet and then smiled at Jon. “Let’s brainstorm together. What’s your favorite book?”
                            
                            Jon thought for a moment. “Probably ‘Harry Potter’. I’ve always loved the magic and adventure.”
                            
                            Susan nodded. “Great choice! Why do you like it so much?”
                            
                            As Jon started to talk about the book, his eyes lit up. He described the characters, the plot, and the magical world with enthusiasm. Susan and James listened intently, occasionally asking questions and prompting him to elaborate.
                            
                            “See?” Susan said after a while. “You’ve already got some great ideas. Let’s get them down on paper.”
                            
                            They spent the afternoon in the library, jotting down notes and organizing Jon’s thoughts. They broke the task into smaller steps, making it less overwhelming. Jon wrote a rough draft, and Susan helped him refine it, while James offered encouragement and feedback.
                            
                            When Jon handed in his essay, he felt a mix of nerves and hope. A week later, his teacher praised his improvement, and Jon felt a spark of pride.
                            
                            “You guys are the best,” Jon said. “I actually enjoyed writing this time.”
