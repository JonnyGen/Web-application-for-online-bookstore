                            The History Hurdle
                            Jon’s history class was a blur of dates, names, and events. He couldn’t keep anything straight, and his grades reflected his struggle. The upcoming project felt like a weight on his shoulders, and he didn’t know where to start.
                            
                            James noticed Jon’s dejected expression. “What’s going on?”
                            
                            “History project. I’m lost.”
                            
                            Susan joined them, her eyes lighting up with an idea. “Why don’t we make it a story? We can act out the events.”
                            
                            They gathered at Jon’s house, transforming the living room into a stage. James and Susan helped Jon script a play, acting out historical events. They chose a period in history that Jon found interesting—the American Revolution. Together, they researched key events, figures, and dates, turning them into scenes for their play.
                            
                            They practiced for days, each taking on different roles. James played George Washington, Susan was a British general, and Jon took on the role of a young revolutionary. Through this creative process, the information became more memorable and engaging.
                            
                            When it was time for Jon to present his project, he felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. He set up the stage in front of his classmates, narrating the story while James and Susan acted out the scenes. His classmates were engaged and entertained, and his teacher praised his creativity and understanding of the material.
                            
                            “Thanks, guys. You made history fun,” Jon said, feeling a new appreciation for the subject.
