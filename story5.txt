                            Jon dreaded gym class. His lack of coordination and speed made him feel out of place. Today was the obstacle course, and Jon’s stomach churned with anxiety as he watched his classmates breeze through the course with ease.
                            
                            James saw Jon lagging behind and approached him. “You got this, Jon. Let’s do it together.”
                            
                            Susan joined them, her enthusiasm infectious. “We’ll practice after school. It’ll be fun!”
                            
                            They spent hours in the park, running and jumping, turning the practice into a game. They set up makeshift obstacles using whatever they could find—benches, trees, and playground equipment. Susan demonstrated techniques to improve balance and coordination, while James encouraged Jon to keep pushing himself.
                            
                            Slowly but surely, Jon’s confidence grew. He started to enjoy the practice sessions, laughing and competing with his friends. Susan and James cheered him on, pushing him to keep going and celebrating his progress.
                            
                            The next gym class, Jon approached the obstacle course with less fear. He wasn’t the fastest, but he completed it without hesitation. His teacher noticed his improvement and praised his effort, commending him for his perseverance.
                            
                            “Thanks for believing in me,” Jon said to his friends. “I feel like I can do anything with you guys by my side.”
                            
                            Susan and James smiled. “We’re a team,” James said. “We’ve got your back.”
                            
                            “And we always will,” Susan added.
